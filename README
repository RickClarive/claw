This is the new Clarive Worker agent, rewritten in Node.

This is totally WIP and will be rewritten many times still.

Rulebook example:

    do:
       - write_file:
           file: /tmp/hello.txt
           body: hello there
       - ship:
           host: abc
           from: /tmp/hello.txt
           to: /tmp/hello2.txt
           mode: file
       - res = shell:
           host: abc
           cmd: 'ls /tmp/'
       - echo: "${res.output}"
